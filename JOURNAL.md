## 11/3/2025 - Thought of the Main Idea and Beginning the Schematic Design

Alright, so first I had to figure out which components I needed for the device.. I figured I needed a module that would allow me to connect the device to another device through Wi-Fi or Bluetooth signals of course.. And as a first thought I thought of having a controller that works using a gyro instead of an infrared sensor, so i needed to add that too..
Now, of course no one likes wired, nor batteries, so instead I added a Lithium Battery module so that it could be charged using USB-C. But of course no one likes battery explosions, so I also added indicator LEDs too..
Perfect, the idea is complete.. now for the schematic.
(btw i learned how to use KiCad like two days ago so it looks very very sloppy)
